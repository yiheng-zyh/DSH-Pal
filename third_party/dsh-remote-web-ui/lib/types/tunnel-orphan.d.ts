/**
 * Crash recovery for the tunnel's cloudflared child. A host that dies without
 * tearing its tunnel down hands the child over to launchd/systemd, where it
 * keeps its edge registration forever: the next host then runs a second
 * connector beside an orphan nobody serves, and the old process holds a
 * hostname no tunnel answers on any more.
 *
 * The manager records the spawned child under the DSH home right after the
 * spawn (pid plus the exact command line ps/proc reports) and drops the record
 * when that child is stopped, so a record only outlives the process that wrote
 * it when that process crashed. The next start reaps exactly that pid, and
 * only while it is still alive AND its command line still equals the recorded
 * one: a recycled pid or a rewritten record can therefore never make the
 * plugin signal a process it did not spawn. Nothing here matches by pattern,
 * by process name, or by any pid this plugin did not record itself.
 *
 * A record also carries the pid of the host that spawned the child. Two live
 * hosts can share one DSH home (two profiles, or a plugin reload inside one
 * host), and each owns its own child; only a host that is gone leaves a child
 * behind, so a record whose owner is still running is left untouched.
