/**
 * The landing page's network-source decision: which origin a paired phone
 * should keep using.
 *
 * The QR link can only name one base, and the server cannot know whether the
 * scanning phone sits on this machine's own network: the public (relayed)
 * base is the only one that is always reachable, so the QR names it and the
 * phone decides at connect time. The device-gated landing (/pair-app) is the
 * plugin's own page already rendered ahead of the official shell's boot, so it
 * is the natural place to probe: after the page is served, a short
 * cross-origin `fetch` per LAN candidate (a no-cors GET at
 * {@link LAN_PING_PATH}) tells the browser whether that LAN origin answers,
 * and the first one that does becomes the new origin. A probe that finds
 * nothing, or that runs out of budget, changes nothing — the page the phone
 * already holds stays paired and usable, so the probe can never block pairing.
 *
 * Browsers do not block this probe. An https page may not normally fetch
 * `http://` subresources, but a host that is an IP literal is exempt from both
 * the block and the automatic upgrade (verified against Chrome: the console
 * reports "This request was not upgraded to HTTPS because its URL's host is an
 * IP address" and delivers the response), which is exactly the shape every LAN
 * candidate has.
