/**
 * The bridge connector: the plugin side of the relay bridge, grown from the
 * shadow-flight probe (`probe/relay-bridge/connector.mjs`).
 *
 * It dials the instance's Durable Object meeting point over WSS and serves
 * every stream the object multiplexes onto that one socket -- HTTP requests
 * with streamed bodies and responses, and the phone's own WebSocket upgrades.
 *
 * Two rules are not negotiable here:
 *
 *  1. The credential is the relay identity's own long-lived id and secret, sent
 *     in the upgrade's `authorization` header so it never appears in a URL. A
 *     dropped socket is re-dialed with the same credential; the object replaces
 *     the socket it already holds, so a reconnect needs no new ticket and no
 *     new instance.
 *  2. The connector never invents the `Host` it sends upstream. It carries the
 *     public origin the phone dialed -- the object reads it from the request
 *     URL and puts it in the frame, and the fallback is this instance's claimed
 *     relay hostname. It never substitutes the loopback authority it dials: the
 *     host's local control plane (`/remote-bridge/pair/token`, `/api/pair/*`,
 *     `/api/update/*`, `/api/plugin-manager`) is gated on the socket address
 *     AND a loopback Host, so rewriting this header would publish that control
 *     plane on the public origin.
 *
 * Frames mirror `market/worker/src/relay-bridge.js`: control frames are JSON
 * text, payload frames are `[kind:u8][streamId:u32be][payload]`.
