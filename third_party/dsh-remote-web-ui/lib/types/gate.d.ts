 * The `api/gate` listener: application-level access control layered on top

 * an authentication layer — packages/client/connection documents this
 * event as the sanctioned seam for pairing/revocation).
 *
 * Policy: loopback requests (the desktop) pass without a device identity;
 * every non-loopback /api request must carry a live, non-revoked device
 * cookie — intended to make the QR the only way into a LAN-exposed dsh web
 * and to give "停止" real teeth for direct /api callers.
 *
 * Cohort reality (0.1.2-alpha.2): NOTHING emits api/gate in the official
 * runtime, so this listener never fires there and direct /api is governed
 * solely by the harness fence + browser-auth cookie. The pairing gate with
 * real teeth lives on the plugin's own /remote channel (remote-api.ts); the
 * listener stays wired for cohort lines that do carry the seam, and the
 * README security model states the gap plainly.
