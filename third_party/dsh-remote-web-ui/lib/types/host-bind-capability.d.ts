 * The managed LAN-bind block used to pin `host: '0.0.0.0'`. Since
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-webserver@0.2.1-rc.2` the webserver `Config` schema
 * rejects the unspecified (wildcard) address, so such a block is refused at
 * config validation and every later `dsh web` start fails. This module is the
 * one place that asks the installed package instead of assuming, and the block
 * planner reads its answer.
 *
 * The value import below is a devDependency of this package and stays external
 * in the published bundle (see the package tsdown config's libExternal): the
 * host process resolves it from the profile tree, which is exactly the module
 * it is about to compose. A host this module cannot interrogate is never
 * assumed permissive - every failure path answers "no wildcard", because an
 * unreadable package must not make the block pin a literal that refuses to
 * boot.
