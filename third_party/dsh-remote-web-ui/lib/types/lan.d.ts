/**
 * LAN address derivation for the pairing URLs. Mirrors the dsh CLI's
 * boot-time sampling (apps/cli/src/app-cli-entry.ts `resolveLanTrust`): the
 * pairing links may only name addresses the /api trust fence was configured
 * with, so the same non-internal IPv4 derivation applies here — an external
 * plugin cannot read the CLI's sampled snapshot, but the fence accepts
 * exactly these literals, which is the property that matters.
 *
 * One derivation is deliberately narrower than the CLI's: everything this
 * module returns is advertised to a phone (the QR base, the landing page's
 * LAN probe, and the fence's trusted-literal list), and an advertised literal
 * the peer can never reach costs a phone the whole pairing attempt. A macOS
 * host running a fake-IP proxy (Clash/Surge/Mihomo) samples its TUN gateway as
 * `198.18.0.1`, which is a benchmarking-range address no LAN peer can route
 * to; the old derivation advertised it like any other interface. The filter
 * below drops the interface kinds and address ranges a peer cannot reach, and
 * keeps everything else — RFC1918, ULA-side IPv4 and a routable public literal
 * (a VPS whose NIC is its only reachable base must stay advertisable).
