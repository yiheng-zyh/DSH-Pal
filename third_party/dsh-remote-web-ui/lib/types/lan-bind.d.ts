/**
 * The lan-bind block this plugin used to write, and its removal (issue #1917).
 *
 * Up to 0.4.8 the toggle pinned the LAN address into the profile's
 * `cordis.patch.yml` as a managed `- id: webserver` row. That approach is
 * retired for two measured reasons:
 *
 * 1. A same-id patch row REPLACES the whole row config, so the block silently
 *    swallowed the official row's own bind expression; the CLI `--host` /
 *    `--port` never reached the running row, and the machine's port came from
 *    a literal this plugin guessed.
 * 2. The profile patch is exactly what the Host's HMR config watcher refreshes
 *    from, so writing it recomposed the running process and rebound the live
 *    listener - the "takes effect on the next start" premise was false, and a
 *    write made mid-session moved the bind under the running host.
 *
 * LAN reachability now comes from a runtime forwarder instead (lan-forward.ts),
 * so the host always listens on loopback and this module's only remaining job
 * is to remove the block older versions left behind. The removal is
 * strip-only: no write appends anything, so the official webserver row (and
 * every other row) stays byte-identical. The block discipline (markers, atomic
 * write) follows the dsh-LAN reference implementation (MIT).
