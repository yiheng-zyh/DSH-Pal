/**
 * The LAN edge the lan-bind toggle owns (issue #1917).
 *
 * The toggle used to pin the LAN address into the profile's webserver row. That
 * row is the only place the harness takes its bind from, and rewriting it
 *   - replaced the official row's whole config (so the row's own
 *     `host: !!js ctx.webStartup.host ?? '127.0.0.1'` expression and the CLI
 *     `--host`/`--port` never reached it), and
 *   - the profile patch is watched by the Host's HMR config watcher, so the
 *     write recomposed the running process and rebound the live listener.
 *
 * This module keeps the host bound to loopback and gives LAN clients their own
 * listener: a forwarder on the machine's LAN address, on the same port, that
 * re-issues every request (HTTP and WebSocket upgrade alike) to
 * `127.0.0.1:<port>`. Two consequences are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. The upstream leg is loopback, so the socket alone would read as "the
 *    desktop". The forwarder therefore DROPS whatever Host the client sent and
 *    stamps the LAN authority it was reached at, plus `X-Forwarded-For`. Every
 *    fence that decides "is this the desktop" (`isLoopbackClient`, the pairing
 *    gate, the `/remote` gate) then keeps refusing the forwarded request, while
 *    the phone-facing fences still match the LAN authority the QR advertises.
 * 2. A bind that cannot be taken (address gone after a network change, port
 *    taken) only loses the LAN edge: the loopback listener is never touched, so
 *    the host cannot be bricked and the failure is reported on the status
 *    frame.
 *
 * Nothing here writes a file: the forwarder is runtime state, so a network
 * change needs no profile edit and no restart.
 *
